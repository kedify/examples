# KEDA meets Gateway API

In this tutorial, we'll explore KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) with Kedify, a tool that simplifies KEDA installation and management. You'll learn how to install KEDA with Kedify, see how to integrate HTTP trigger with Gateway APIi, and how dynamic routing along with autoscaling can optimize application deployments.

Kedify automates KEDA installation and lifecycle management on your Kubernetes cluster, including upgrades. KEDA's HTTP scaler lets you adjust application instances based on incoming HTTP requests, ensuring responsiveness during high traffic and optimizing resources during low traffic.

Kedify's HTTP Scaler is more performant than the KEDA upstream version. For details, see the [Kedify HTTP Scaler blog post](https://kedify.io/resources/blog/http-scaler-launch).
