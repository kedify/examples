# gRPC Responder

This is a simple gRPC server implemented in Go that responds with a configurable message and delay. The server can optionally be run with TLS enabled for secure communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `grpcurl` installed for testing the gRPC service
- `openssl` installed for generating TLS certificates

### Building the Project

To build the project, use the following command:

```bash
make build
```

### Running the Server

You can run the server with or without TLS enabled. The behavior of the server can be configured using the following environment variables:

#### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: The port on which the gRPC server will listen. Defaults to `50051`.
- `RESPONSE_DELAY`: The delay in seconds before the server responds. Can be a floating-point number. Defaults to `0`.
- `RESPONSE_MESSAGE`: The message the server will respond with. Defaults to `"Hello from Kedify"`.
- `TLS_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable TLS. Defaults to `false`.
- `TLS_CERT_FILE`: The path to the TLS certificate file. Required if `TLS_ENABLED` is `true`.
- `TLS_KEY_FILE`: The path to the TLS key file. Required if `TLS_ENABLED` is `true`.

#### Running Without TLS

To run the server without TLS, simply execute:

```bash
make run
```

This will start the server on the default port `50051` with the default message and no delay.

#### Running with TLS

To run the server with TLS enabled, execute:

```bash
make run TLS_ENABLED=true
```

This command will generate the necessary TLS certificates, start the server with TLS enabled, and use the default port `50051`.

### Testing the Server with grpcurl

You can test the server using `grpcurl`. Below are examples for both TLS-enabled and TLS-disabled scenarios.

#### Testing Without TLS

If TLS is not enabled, you can test the server with the following `grpcurl` command:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"name": "Test"}' localhost:50051 responder.HelloService/SayHello
```

#### Testing with TLS

If TLS is enabled, use the following `grpcurl` command:

```bash
grpcurl -d '{"name": "Test"}' -cacert server.crt localhost:50051 responder.HelloService/SayHello
```

This command assumes that `server.crt` is the certificate file generated by the `Makefile` during the `make run` command.

### Cleaning Up

To clean up the generated files, including the binary and TLS certificates, run:

```bash
make clean
```
